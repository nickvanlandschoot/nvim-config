### claude-inline.nvim (AI Inline Editing)

**Features:**

- Inline prompts - Floating window interface for entering edit instructions
- Preview changes - Optional diff preview before applying changes
- Smart indentation - Preserves original indentation patterns
- Undo support - All edits can be undone with regular Neovim undo

**Usage:**

1. Select text in visual mode (v, V, or Ctrl-V)
2. Press `<C-k>` to trigger inline edit
3. Type your instruction in the floating prompt
4. Press `<CR>` to apply the edit or `<Esc>` to cancel
5. If preview is enabled, review changes and press `<CR>` to accept or `<Esc>` to reject

**Keybindings:**

- `<C-k>` (in visual mode) - Trigger Claude inline edit
- `<CR>` - Accept AI suggestion/changes
- `<Esc>` - Cancel operation
- `<C-u>` - Scroll up in preview window
- `<C-d>` - Scroll down in preview window

**Example Instructions:**

- "Convert this to TypeScript"
- "Add error handling"
- "Refactor to use async/await"
- "Add JSDoc comments"
- "Make this more idiomatic"
- "Optimize this algorithm"

**Note:** Requires Claude Code CLI to be installed and available in your PATH.

### claude-diff (Live Diff Viewer)

**Features:**

- Live inline diffs - Shows Claude's file changes with visual highlights
- Deleted text preview - Deletion hunks show the removed content as virtual lines
- Conflict detection - Automatically marks hunks that overlap with your edits
- Accept/reject/merge - Review and apply changes selectively
- Telescope integration - Browse all diffs with inline preview
- Smart baseline tracking - Maintains history for proper diff resolution
- Session persistence - Hunks persist between Neovim sessions
- Dynamic adjustment - Hunks automatically shift when you edit above them

**How it Works:**

1. Claude modifies a file externally (via Claude Code CLI)
2. Plugin automatically detects the change and shows inline diffs
3. You can review, accept, reject, or merge each change (hunk)
4. Changes that overlap with your edits are marked as conflicts

**Navigation:**

- `]h` - Jump to next Claude hunk
- `[h` - Jump to previous Claude hunk

**Hunk Actions:**

- `<Space>+ha` - Accept Claude's changes (overwrite current)
- `<Space>+hr` - Reject Claude's changes (keep current)
- `<Space>+hb` - Accept both (creates conflict markers for manual merge)
- `<Space>+hl` - List all hunks in current buffer (Telescope)
- `<Space>+hL` - List all hunks across project (Telescope)

**Commands:**

- `:ClaudeNextDiff` - Navigate to next diff hunk
- `:ClaudePrevDiff` - Navigate to previous diff hunk
- `:ClaudeAcceptHunk` - Accept the hunk at cursor
- `:ClaudeRejectHunk` - Reject the hunk at cursor
- `:ClaudeAcceptBoth` - Create conflict markers with both versions
- `:ClaudeAcceptAll` - Accept all Claude changes in current buffer
- `:ClaudeRejectAll` - Reject all Claude changes in current buffer
- `:ClaudeDiffs` - Open Telescope picker for current buffer's diffs
- `:ClaudeProjectDiffs` - Open Telescope picker for all diffs across project

**Telescope Picker Actions:**

- `<CR>` - Jump to selected diff
- `a` - Accept selected hunk
- `r` - Reject selected hunk
- `b` - Accept both (create conflict markers)
- `<C-a>` - Accept (insert mode)
- `<C-r>` - Reject (insert mode)
- `<C-b>` - Accept both (insert mode)

**Visual Highlights:**

- Green (DiffAdd) - Claude added new code
- Blue (DiffChange) - Claude modified existing code
- Red (DiffDelete) - Claude removed code (deleted lines shown as virtual text below)
- Red highlight (ErrorMsg) - Conflict: both you and Claude edited this area

**Workflow Example:**

1. You're editing a file, make some changes
2. Claude modifies the same file via CLI
3. You see inline diffs appear automatically (within 3 seconds or on cursor move)
4. Navigate with `]h` and `[h`
5. For each hunk: accept (`<Space>+ha`), reject (`<Space>+hr`), or merge (`<Space>+hb`)
6. Conflicted hunks (red) indicate overlap with your edits
7. Use `<Space>+hb` on conflicts to create merge markers
8. Or use `<Space>+hl` to review all diffs in Telescope

**Configuration:**

```lua
require("claude_diff").setup({
  keymaps = true,           -- Enable default keymaps (set to false to disable)
  check_interval = 3000,    -- Check for file changes every 3 seconds (in milliseconds)
})
```

**Testing:**
The plugin includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability:

- Run tests: `:ClaudeRunTests` (requires plenary.nvim)
- See `tests/README.md` for detailed testing documentation

**Note:** The plugin uses multiple detection methods:

- Automatic periodic checking (every 3 seconds by default)
- On cursor movement or focus changes
- On external file modifications (via `FileChangedShellPost`)
  Adjust `check_interval` to balance responsiveness vs performance (lower = more responsive, higher = less CPU usage).

### octo.nvim (GitHub Integration)

**Setup:**
Octo.nvim integrates GitHub directly into Neovim with all TUI elements displayed in floating windows. You'll need to authenticate first:

1. Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` (or your package manager)

### TypeScript JSX Configuration

If you're getting **"Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided [17004]"** errors in TypeScript projects:

**Quick Fix:** Create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project root:

```bash
# Copy the template to your project
cp ~/.config/nvim/tsconfig-template.json ./tsconfig.json
```

**Or create manually with minimum JSX settings:**

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "react",
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*", "*.ts", "*.tsx", "*.js", "*.jsx"]
}
```

**Key JSX Settings:**

- `"jsx": "react-jsx"` - Enables modern JSX transform (React 17+)
- `"jsx": "react"` - For older React versions
- `"jsx": "preserve"` - For Next.js or custom build tools
- `"jsxImportSource": "react"` - Specifies JSX import source

**Alternative JSX options:**

- `"jsx": "react-native"` - For React Native projects
- `"jsx": "preserve"` - Keeps JSX as-is for bundlers like Vite/Next.js
